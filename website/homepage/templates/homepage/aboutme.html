 <!-- TODO add some images and align to paragraphs. -->


        <p>I am (was?) a scientist that enjoys trying to work with technology.
            Previously I worked with parasites (Leishmania and Trypanosoma).</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am reasonably handy with Python, which I use for automation, some web development (Django) and data analysis & visualization.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have a dog and an annoying cat who leave hair everywhere as they chase each other.</p>
