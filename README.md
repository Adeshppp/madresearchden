The project consists of Docker containers for:
- a Django app
- a postgres database
- certbot ssl certificate creation
- a bokeh server for interative plots
- an nginx web server

The script init-letsencrypt.sh is used to get a dummy ssl cert, start nginx and the request real ssl certs via certbot.
